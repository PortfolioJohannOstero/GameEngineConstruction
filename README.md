This is a Teesside Uni project where we have to create our own custom engine, using a very simplified api made by Keith Ditchburn

The game is a 2D Horizontal plane shooter. It is going to be a semi-physics based game, where gravity is a factor. This means that the plane can fall down to the ground, crash into various other objects and based on the angle or speed will eliminate the plane.
As it is a plane shooter, the game will include shooting various projectiles, such as rockets and regular machine gun bullets. The game is heavily inspired by Triplane Turmoil 
As of now, the game will only have versus mode.
